# Syntax Error Fix - core/search.py

## Problem Found

**File**: `core/search.py`  
**Line**: 156  
**Error**: `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`

### The Bad Code
```python
streamlit run ui/app_streamlit.py    # Note: 'params' argument removed for compatibility with Qdrant 1.9.2
```

This line was accidentally left in the file (probably from a copy-paste or testing), which caused a Python syntax error when the module was imported.

### The Fix
Removed the invalid command and kept only the comment:

```python
# Note: 'params' argument removed for compatibility with Qdrant 1.9.2
# In newer versions, you can add: params=qmodels.SearchParams(hnsw_ef=128)
```

## Impact

This syntax error prevented:
- ❌ The `core.search` module from being imported
- ❌ The `core.qa` module from loading (depends on search)
- ❌ The Streamlit app from starting

## Result

✅ **Fixed!** Streamlit app now running at http://localhost:8501

## Files Modified

- `core/search.py` (line 156) - Removed invalid command line
